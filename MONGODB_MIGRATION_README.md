# MongoDB Migration Update

## Overview

We've completed the migration from Prisma ORM to Mongoose for direct MongoDB access. This migration enhances performance, simplifies our data layer, and gives us more control over database operations.

## Key Benefits

- **Better Performance**: Direct MongoDB operations are more efficient
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Mongoose schemas provide powerful validation
- **Simplified Maintenance**: No more schema migrations to manage
- **Reduced Dependencies**: Removed Prisma as a dependency
- **Improved Control**: Direct access to MongoDB features

## Migration Resources

- `MONGOOSE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete technical guide
- `MONGOOSE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference for common operations
- `MIGRATION_FINAL_STEPS.md` - Steps to finalize the migration

## Key Changes

1. **Database Connection**
   - New connection management in `src/lib/dbConnect.ts`
   - Environment variables remain the same

2. **Model Structure**
   - Mongoose schemas in `src/models/`
   - Type definitions updated to use Mongoose types

3. **Authentication**
   - Custom Mongoose adapter for NextAuth
   - Enhanced user authentication flows

4. **API Routes**
   - All API routes updated to use Mongoose
   - Consistent error handling and response formats

## Usage Examples

### Connecting to the Database

```typescript
import dbConnect from '@/lib/dbConnect';

async function myFunction() {
  await dbConnect();
  // Your code here
}
```

### Working with Models

```typescript
import Product from '@/models/Product';

// Find products
const products = await Product.find().populate('categoryId');

// Create a product
const newProduct = await Product.create({
  name: 'New Product',
  price: 100,
  // other fields...
});
```

## Next Steps

1. Review the `MONGOOSE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for common patterns
2. Update any custom code that was using Prisma
3. Test all critical user flows

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues, the Prisma schema and code are archived in the `prisma-backup` branch.
