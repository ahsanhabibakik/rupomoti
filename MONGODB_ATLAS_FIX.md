# MongoDB Atlas Production Fix Guide

## The Problem

Your Rupomoti site works locally but fails in production because of **MongoDB Atlas Network Access restrictions**.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. ✅ **Database URL is correct** - We verified the connection string works locally
2. ✅ **Environment variables are set** - All variables are correctly configured in Vercel
3. ✅ **Code deploys successfully** - The site loads at www.rupomoti.com
4. ❌ **Database access is blocked** - MongoDB Atlas is blocking Vercel's IP addresses

## The Fix

### Step 1: MongoDB Atlas Network Access

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas Dashboard](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Navigate to your cluster → **Network Access**
3. Click **"Add IP Address"**
4. Choose **"Allow access from anywhere"** (0.0.0.0/0)
   - This temporarily allows all IPs for testing
5. Click **"Confirm"**

### Step 2: Test the Fix

After updating MongoDB Atlas, test these endpoints:

- https://www.rupomoti.com/api/health
- https://www.rupomoti.com/api/categories
- https://www.rupomoti.com/api/products

They should return data instead of 500 errors.

### Step 3: Production Security (Recommended)

For production security, instead of allowing all IPs:

1. Get Vercel's IP ranges from their documentation
2. Add only Vercel's IP ranges to MongoDB Atlas
3. Or use MongoDB Atlas's built-in Vercel integration

## Why This 

- MongoDB Atlas blocks all connections by default for security
- Local development works because your home IP is usually whitelisted
- Vercel uses dynamic IP addresses that aren't in your whitelist
- This is the #1 cause of "works locally, fails in production" database issues

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test if the fix worked
curl https://www.rupomoti.com/api/health
curl https://www.rupomoti.com/api/categories
```

## Expected Results After Fix

✅ API endpoints return JSON data instead of 500 errors
✅ Homepage loads with actual products and categories
✅ Admin panel can access database
✅ Full e-commerce functionality restored
