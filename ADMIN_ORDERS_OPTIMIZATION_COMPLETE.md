- **Emoji enhancements** for better visual appeal

### **5. Performance Optimizations**
- **Memoized computations** for expensive operations
- **Optimized re-renders** with proper dependency arrays
- **Smart state management** to prevent unnecessary updates
- **Efficient selection handling** for bulk operations
- **Background update strategies** that don't interfere with user actions

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features Enhanced**

### **Query Strategy**
```typescript
// Before: Aggressive 0ms stale time, 10s intervals
staleTime: 0,
gcTime: 0,
refetchInterval: 10000

// After: Balanced performance and freshness
staleTime: 30000, // 30 seconds
gcTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
refetchInterval: status === 'active' ? 30000 : 60000
```

### **Optimistic Updates**
- All mutations now provide immediate UI feedback
- Rollback functionality on errors
- Cross-tab synchronization for real-time collaboration
- Broadcast messages with detailed action information

### **Enhanced PDF Generation**
- **Single Order PDF**: Modern design with Inter font, color-coded status badges
- **Bulk PDF Export**: Optimized layout for multiple orders with page breaks
- **Progress feedback**: Toast notifications for bulk operations
- **Error handling**: Popup blocker detection and user guidance

### **Smart Pagination**
- Increased default page size to 20 for better data density
- Maintains all existing pagination features
- Optimized for mobile and desktop experiences

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Improvements**

### **Code Quality**
- Removed unused imports and variables
- Fixed TypeScript warnings and errors
- Improved type safety throughout the component
- Better error boundaries and handling

### **Performance Metrics**
